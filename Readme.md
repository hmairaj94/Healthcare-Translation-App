## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The application uses a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript for the user interface
- **Backend**: Flask for API endpoints and server-side processing
- **AI Translation**: Mistral LLM via Ollama API for medical-focused translations
- **Speech Recognition**: Web Speech API for real-time voice transcription
- **Speech Synthesis**: Web Speech API for audio playback of translated text

### Security Considerations

- No persistent storage of patient data
- Rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Error handling without exposing implementation details
- HTTPS for secure data transmission (in production)
- Session management with proper timeout

## üì± How to Use

1. **Select Languages**:
   - Choose your source language (the language being spoken)
   - Choose the target language (the language to translate to)

2. **Record Speech**:
   - Click the microphone button to start recording
   - Speak clearly into your device's microphone
   - The app will transcribe your speech in real-time

3. **View Translation**:
   - Watch as the translation appears in the "Translated Text" section
   - Click the speaker button to hear the translation spoken aloud

4. **Clear and Reset**:
   - Use the clear button (X) to reset both transcripts

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create a .env file or set these in your environment
   export SECRET_KEY="your_secure_secret_key"
   export OLLAMA_URL="http://localhost:11434/api/generate"  # Or your LLM API URL
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## üß™ Testing

The application includes basic error handling and recovery:
- Microphone permission detection
- Network status monitoring
- Translation service error handling
- Speech recognition recovery attempts

For manual testing:
1. Test with different language combinations
2. Verify medical terminology is correctly translated
3. Check responsive design on various device sizes
4. Confirm error states display user-friendly messages

## üìö Future Enhancements

- Specialized medical dictionary integration
- Support for more languages and dialects
- Offline mode for basic functionality
- Custom voice selection for audio playback
- Translation history with anonymized data
- Image-to-text for medical documents
